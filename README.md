## Steps to Setup the Environment on Windows:

1. Download and install Alchitry Labs (This is kind of the IDE using which we write, build, debug and flash programs into the board). Link: [Click Here](https://alchitry.com/alchitry-labs/)
2. Download Vivado, to be more specific, I downloaded the exec file named "AMD Unified Installer for FPGAs & Adaptive SoCs 2024.2: Windows Self Extracting Web Installer (EXE - 222.91 MB)" from [Here](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html). You will need to sign-up and account at the AMD website to be able to download it. It is all free as of now.
3. Make sure Windows defender and all anti-viruses are disabled. This speeds up the process.
4. Run the executable. Input email and password using which you signed up before.
5. Select the Product: "Vivado". Hit Next.
6. Select "Vivado ML Standard". Hit Next.
7. Keep all the default settings (changing the default settings might work, but I did not try it, I just went with the default settings). Then, hit next.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7417a72b-47bb-4e86-819b-a6b87fc3ef00)
8. It first downloads a lot of things. Then, it starts the installation, during installation part, no internet is required. You can turn internet off.
9. After installation is completed, you can try out programming the board following this video: [Click Here](https://youtu.be/qs5OUNB868Q?si=jmp04Pl4BGJJgcxk)

That's all. Thank you!
